* ~d12-hs-path~

Path helpers for my personal projects. Currently exposes only one module -
~Path.Parse~. Please refer to it for list of all exposed functions. But let me
show you two functions which I use the most.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  λ> :t parseFilePath
  parseFilePath
    :: (MonadThrow m, MonadIO m) => Text -> m (Path Abs File)
  λ> parseFilePath "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.gitignore"
  "/Users/d12frosted/.environment/.gitignore"
  λ> :t parseDirPath
  parseDirPath
    :: (MonadThrow m, MonadIO m) => Text -> m (Path Abs Dir)
  λ> parseDirPath "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"
  "/Users/d12frosted/.environment/"
  λ> parseDirPath "$FALSE"
  *** Exception: Could not find value of $FALSE in environment.
  λ> parseDirPath "~/Developer"
  "/Users/d12frosted/Developer/"
#+END_SRC

Both of them are great for parsing path from user input. Because they expand
environment variables and =~/=.

At some extent this library was created after [[https://github.com/d12frosted/CanonicalPath][CanonicalPath]] was deprecated.
Thanks to Chris Done now we have a better type for path.

** Using with ~stack~

Just add =d12-hs-path= to =stack.yaml= file.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  packages:
  - '.'
  - location:
      git: https://github.com/d12frosted/d12-hs-path
